/**
 * This package contains all of the basic datastructures that you need to create most programs. There are helpful
 * versions of these structures that can act as multiple different structures if need be (for example, a map can
 * also be treated like a list). Note that all List structures in this class define the Iterable and Iterator java
 * standard interfaces and can be used wherever those interfaces are requried.
